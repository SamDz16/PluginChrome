# Trigger Luis Algorithms - Google chrome extension
This extension will alter the dom of the sparql DBPedia to add a checkbox right before the Execute Query button of the form. The, the user has the choice to choose whether he would like to use Luis algorithms or not. Based on his choice, we could have two possible scenarios:

1 User didn't check the checkbox: in this case we don't use Luis algorithms (default one)
2 User checked to use Luis algorithms: in this case we modify the default treatment and use instead Luis algorithms
